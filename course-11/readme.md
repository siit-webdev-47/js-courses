# Course 11

## Recap - Continue development of the Math application
1. Reviewing the already written code- `Recording minute 0:06:45`
2. Refactoring the code by implementing the correct answer as a global variable- `Recording minute 0:28:31`
2. Using the event object to determine the clicked answer and determining if it is correct - `Recording minute 0:47:29`

## Asynchronous code in JavaScript
1. Using setInterval() - recap - `Recording minute 1:10:32`
2. Using setTimeout() - `Recording minute 1:12:46`
3. Using setTimeout() is not executed always after the specified time if on the stack there is a task already running - `Recording minute 1:14:01`
4. Event listeners actually push the execution of the event handlers on the tasks queue - `Recording minute 1:22:23`
5. JS Event loop explained: the Stack, The HEAP, The Browser API, The callback queue - `Recording minute 1:40:58`

## Fetching data from an API
1. URL segments: protocol, domain, path, query parameters, fragment  - `Recording minute 2:06:00`
2. The HTTP Protocol - `Recording minute 2:08:47`
3. What is an API - `Recording minute 2:20:01`
4. Retrieving data from an API using fetch() - `Recording minute 2:33:09`
